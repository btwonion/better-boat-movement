## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure your boat-jumping experience via `/config/better-boat-movement.json`:

```json5
{
    "version": 5, // just ignore that, only for migrations
    "config": {
        "stepHeight": 0.35, // The amount of blocks you are going to be boosted when triggering a boost
        "playerEjectTicks": 200.0, // The ticks the game waits before kicking you out of a boat after the player lost control
        "boostUnderwater": true, // Toggles, whether a boat, which is underwater should be boosted upwards
        "boostOnBlocks": true, // Toggles, whether a boat, which is on a block should be boosted upwards when running against an elevation
        "boostOnIce": false, // Toggles, whether a boat, should only be boosted on blocks, when laying on an ice block.
        "boostOnWater": true, // Toggles, whether a boat, which is on water should be boosted upwards when floating against an elevation
        "onlyForPlayers": true, // Toggles, whether a boat should only be boosted when carrying a player
        "extraCollisionDetectionRange": 0.5, // Changes the detection range of a collision. Increasing this will boost a boat x blocks before actually touching the block it approaches.
        "allowJumpKeybind": false, // Toggles, whether a player should be able to jump with a boat via a keybind
        "keybindJumpHeightMultiplier": 1.5, // Specifies the multiplier that will be applied to the jump height when a player uses the keybind to jump
